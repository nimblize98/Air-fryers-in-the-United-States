Can you cook rice in an air fryer?

Cooking plain rice directly in a standard air fryer basket is not very practical because air fryers are designed for dry heat circulation rather than boiling or steaming. Rice typically requires water absorption and moist heat, which traditional methods like stovetop cooking, rice cookers, or pressure cookers handle much better.

However, rice can be prepared in an air fryer if you use an oven-safe dish that fits inside the basket and add the proper water ratio. In this setup, the air fryer acts more like a small oven heating the covered dish. Even then, the process may take longer and can be less consistent compared to dedicated rice-cooking appliances.

Where air fryers truly shine is with rice-based dishes like fried rice, reheating cooked rice, or crisping rice balls and cutlets. For everyday plain rice, a rice cooker or pressure cooker remains the more efficient and reliable option, while the air fryer works better for finishing or transforming rice dishes.
