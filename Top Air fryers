Do air fryers require preheating?

Air fryers do not always require preheating, but doing so can improve cooking results for certain foods. Many modern air fryers heat up very quickly, so some recipes work fine when you start cooking immediately. However, preheating for 2–5 minutes helps the appliance reach the desired temperature faster and can lead to more even browning and crispiness.

Preheating is especially helpful when cooking foods that benefit from an instant high-heat environment, such as fries, chicken, or frozen snacks. It helps create that immediate sear on the outside, which improves texture. For baking items like muffins or cakes, preheating is usually recommended for more consistent results.

In everyday use, whether you preheat depends on the recipe and your air fryer model. While it’s not always mandatory, a short preheat often gives better and more predictable cooking outcomes.
